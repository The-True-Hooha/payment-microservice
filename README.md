## The Project

I have been developing applications the monolithic way, and for someone who 
enjoys picking up new challenges decided to build a customer order delivery system
with a microservice approach.

The main purpose of this project is to explore a startup
idea, build it with a microservice architecture.

Project was built using `Java 17` and `springboot 2.5.7`
